## How to test WebServ 💻 :

You need to make first.

You can find a configuration file similar to that of NGinx in the config folder.

If you just want to start the server to test it on port 80 you can run the ./configure script 

Then run ./webserv without arguments to use default.conf config. (or specified a config file in first argument)

## How to launch ?

`make re && ./configure -y && ./webserv`

then go to localhost:80 by default
